\section{Exercise}
You are given set $\mathcal{R}$ of resources available to you. Resources are called $R_i$ for $i \in 1,\dots , p$.
You are also given limit $\mathcal{L}_i$ of resource $R_i$. At any time, you cannot allot more than $L_i$ units of $R_i$ to activities.
You are given set of activities $\mathcal{Z} = \{1,\dots ,n\}$. 
Every activity $A_j \in \mathcal{A}$ takes $t_j$ units of time to do and vector $\mathbf{r}_j = [r_1, r_2, \dots, r_p]$ of needed resources $R_1, \dots , R_p$
Activities must be done in certain order, that is given by a directed graph. If there is an edge $(A_i, A_j)$ in graph $G$, then $A_i$ must be done before $A_j$

\subsection{Model}
\subsubsection*{Parameters}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $n$ --- Amount of activities $\mathcal{A}$
    \item $p$ --- Amount of resources $\mathcal{R}$
    \item $\mathcal{A}$ --- Activities to do
    \item $\mathcal{R}$ --- Resources to use
    \item $\mathcal{L}_i$ --- Limit set on resource $\mathcal{R}_i$
    \item $\mathbf{r}$ --- Matrix $n \times p$ of resource usage for given activity
    \item $t_j$ --- Time needed to finish activity $t_j$
    \item $G$ --- Graph representation as a set of tuples $(v,w)$. $(v,w) \in G \implies v $ needs to be done before $w$  
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection*{Decision Variables}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $x_i$ --- start time of activity $A_i$
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection*{Constraints}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Every activity has started (and finished) at some point 
    $$x_i \geqslant 0$$
    \item For every edge $(v,w) \in G$, Activity $v$ must be done before $w$
    $$\forall (v,w) \in G : x_v + t_v \leqslant x_w$$
    \item At any point, sum of resource $R_i$ used at that moment cannot be more than $L_i$. It is sufficient to check if start of any activity is eligible.
    $$ A_i \textrm{ started during execution of } A_j \iff x_j \leq x_i \leq x_j + t_j$$
    
    $$
    \forall \mathcal{R}_r \in \mathcal{R} : 
        \forall A_i \in \mathcal{A} : 
            \textbf{r}_{i, r} + 
            \sum_{A_j \in \mathcal{A}, j \neq i}
                ( ||A_i \textrm{ started during execution of } A_j|| \cdot \textbf{r}_{j, r} ) \leq \mathcal{L}_r 
    $$

\end{itemize}
\subsubsection*{Objective Function}
Minimize total time needed to finish all activities
$$\textrm{Minimize } \max\{ x_i + t_i : i \in 1 \dots n \}$$
