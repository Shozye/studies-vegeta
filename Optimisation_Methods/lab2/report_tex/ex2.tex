\section{Exercise - Program Calculating Functions}
$P_{i,j}$ is a subprogram, that takes $r_{i,j}$ space and $t_{i,j}$ time and it calculates function $i$.
Construct a program, that will be able to calculate all functions, will take no more than $M$ space and will have minimal time.

    
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Formulate the problem as Mixed-Integer Programming. \done
    \item Describe it in \texttt{JuMP} and solve it by using \texttt{GLPK} or \texttt{Cbc}. \done
    \item Separate model and data. \done
    \item Maximally parametrize model description. \done
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Model}
\subsubsection*{Parameters}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $m$ --- Amount of subprograms for every function
    \item $n$ --- Amount of functions
    \item $M$ --- Total memory available
    \item $r_{i,j}$ --- Memory taken by function $i$ and its subprogram $j$
    \item $t_{i,j}$ --- Time taken by function $i$ and its subprogram $j$
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection*{Decision Variables}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $x_{i,j}$ --- Was function $i$ calculated with subprogram $j$?
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection*{Constraints}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $x_{i,j}$ answers a question, so it is a binary.
    $$x_{i,j} \textrm{ is a binary }$$
    \item Every function $i \in 1 \dots n$ must be calculated
    $$\sum_{j \in 1 \dots m} x_{i,j} \geqslant 1$$
    \item Total memory taken by subprograms is limited by $M$
    $$\sum_{i \in 1 \dots n, j \in 1 \dots m}  x_{i,j} \cdot r_{i,j} \leqslant M $$
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection*{Objective Function}
Goal is to minimize time taken by whole program
$$
\textrm{Minimize } \sum_{i \in 1 \dots n, j \in 1 \dots m}  x_{i,j} \cdot t_{i,j}
$$
