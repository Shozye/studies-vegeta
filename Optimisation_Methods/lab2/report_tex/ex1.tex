\section{Exercise - Samples and Servers}
There are $m$ samples and $n$ servers.
Samples are stored on servers, one sample can be stored on several of them.
There is cost $T_i$ associated with reaching to server $i$.
Goal is to reach to all the samples with the smallest possible cost.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Formulate the problem as Mixed-Integer Programming. \done
    \item Describe it in \texttt{JuMP} and solve it by using \texttt{GLPK} or \texttt{Cbc}. \done
    \item Separate model and data. \done
    \item Maximally parametrize model description. \done
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{What's Interesting about the problem?}
I have tried to model it as Minimum Flow Problem, 
but I cannot create IF statement in constraints in Julia.
Are these essentialy different problems?

\subsection{Model}
I am essentially imagining it as one of bipartite graph problems. Given graph, and it's two parts $\mathcal{B}, \mathcal{R}$,
Find lowest cost set $S \subseteq \mathcal{B}$ such as $\mathcal{R} \subseteq N(S)$, where $N(S)$ is neighbourhood.
\subsubsection*{Parameters}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\mathcal{B}$ --- Part of blue vertices.
    \item $\mathcal{R}$ --- Part of red vertices.
    \item $q_{b,r}$ --- Matrix of connections between $b \in \mathcal{B}$ and $r \in \mathcal{R}$. 
    \item $T_b$ --- Cost of edge $(s, b)$ for $b \in \mathcal{B}$
    \item $n$ --- $|\mathcal{B}|$
    \item $m$ --- $|\mathcal{R}|$
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection*{Decision Variables}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $x_b$ --- Is $b$ in $S$? $b \in \mathcal{B}$ ? 
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection*{Constraints}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $x_b$ answers question, if something is, so it is binary variable.
    $$x_b\textrm{ is binary} $$
    \item Every red vertex $r$ has connection to blue vertice $b$ that is in $S$
    
    $$\forall_{r \in \mathcal{R}} \mathrm{ } \sum_{b \in \mathcal{B} } q_{b, r} \cdot x_b \geqslant 1 $$
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection*{Objective Function}
We want to minimize cost of set $S$.
$$
\textrm{Minimize } \sum_{b \in \mathcal{B}}  x_b \cdot T_b
$$
