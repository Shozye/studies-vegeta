\section{Exercise - Same Order Scheduling}
There is a set of tasks $Z = \{1, \dots , n\}$, 
that are meant to be executes on processors $P_1, P_2, P_3$ with following assumptions.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item One processor can execute one task at a time
    \item Every task needs to me done first by $P_1$, then on $P_2$, then on $P_3$.
    \item Order of tasks on any processor must be the same the same.
\end{enumerate}
You are given time of execution of task $i$ for processor $j$ by $t^j_i$,
goal is to find such permutation of tasks that will minimize total time when all tasks will be done on $P_3$
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Find such permutation of tasks that will minimize total time when all tasks will be done on $P_3$ \done
    \item Describe such model in \texttt{JuMP} ( \texttt{Julia} ) and solve instance of a problem by \texttt{GLPK} or \texttt{Cbc} \done
    \item Parametrize model description, in particular, for $m$ processors. \done  
    \item Visualize solution in console by using Gantt Diagram \done
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Model}
\subsubsection*{Parameters}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $Z$ --- Set of tasks $Z = \{1, \dots , n\}$
    \item $M$ --- Amount of processors $P_i$
    \item $T_{i, j}$ --- execution time of task $i$ on processor $j$
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection*{Decision Variables}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $s_{i, j}$ --- Execution start time of task $i$ on processor $j$
    \item $p_{i, j}$ --- Precedence matrix for $i, j \in Z$. Binary matrix of tasks, which says if task $i$ is before task $j$.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection*{Constraints}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $p$ is a precedence matrix so
    $$p_{i,j} \textrm{ is binary }$$
    $$p_{i,j} = 1 - p_{j,i}$$
    \item Every task $i$ had to start at every processor $j$. It is sufficient to check only on first processor.
    $$ s_{i, 1} \geqslant 0$$
    \item For any $i$, $P_i$ should finish task $x$ before $P_{i+1}$ starts this task.
    $$s_{x, i} + t_{x, i} \leqslant s_{x, i+1}$$
    \item One processor $p$, can execute one task at a time. 
    If $i$ is before $j$ in permutation, then $i$ should finish executing before $j$ starts.
    $$s_{j, p} + \infty \cdot \neg p_{i,j} \geqslant s_{i,p} + t_{i,p} $$
    
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection*{Objective Function}
We need to minimize finish time of the last task on the last processor.
$$\textrm{Minimize } \max_{i \in Z}{s_{i, M} + t_{i, M}}$$

Solution in \texttt{Julia} can be found in \textit{src/ex3.jl/}.
